                <b>Topic:</b> Abortion has long been a contentious issue in the United States, and it is one that sharply divides Americans along partisan, ideological and religious lines.
                Most abortions are now banned in 13 states following the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Georgia also bans abortion at about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. 
                <br/>
                <b>Personal Opinion:</b> I am pro-choice. I believe abortions shouldn't be banned and it should be upto the woman to decide what to do with her own body.
                <br/>
                <b>Dataset:</b> Linked <a class="dataset-link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/perspectives-on-abortion-1975-2022?resource=download" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <b>Left chart:</b> I have used several rhetorical techniques and framing effects in this chart, such as:
                <span class="list-item">1. Omission: I have ambiguosly defined "Legal" in this chart. That metric is achieved by summing over "Legal under any condition" & "Legal only under certain conditions" metrics </span>
                <span class="list-item">2. Axis scaling: The Y axis ranges from 0 to the highest % value of the metric, and not to 100%, which makes the 80% mark look higher</span>
                <span class="list-item">3. Anchoring: The title of the chart biases the user towards the "Yes" position. The caption below the chart has a smilar effect</span>
                <span class="list-item">4. Sourcing: I identified the dataset origin, which builds confidence about the data in the viewer's mind</span>

                <b>Right chart:</b>  I have used several rhetorical techniques and framing effects in this chart, such as:
                <span class="list-item">1. Omission: I have ambiguosly defined "Legal only under certain conditions" in this chart, as it doesn't say how strict or loose the conditions are. It maybe that the conditions are very relaxed such as "Legal except when mother's health is in extreme risk" or something much more conversative</span>
                <span class="list-item">2. Axis scaling: The Y axis ranges from 0 to 100 %, although the line charts hover below the 60% mark, which makes the legal lines look lower than if the axis was scaled to the max value</span>
